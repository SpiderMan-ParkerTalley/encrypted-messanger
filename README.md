# Description
This is a project that I did for Cryptography for Cybersecurity Practitioners (CYBR-442). The goal of the project was to create a program that could be used to send encrypted messages between two users.

# How to Use
1. Clone the repository locally. 
2. Ensure that you have installed Python 3 and allow traffic on loopback traffic on the port specified in the program (default: 12345).
3. Run the `server.py` script.
4. Run the `client.py` script.
5. Send messages that are encrypted between the server and the client.
6. At any point, send `quit` to end the client and server programs.
